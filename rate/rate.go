// A Limiter controls how frequently events are allowed to happen.

// Limiter has three main methods, Allow, Reserve, and Wait.
// Most callers should use Wait.
//
// Each of the three methods consumes a single token.
// They differ in their behavior when no token is available.
// If no token is available, Allow returns false.
// If no token is available, Reserve returns a reservation for a future token
// and the amount of time the caller must wait before using it.
// If no token is available, Wait blocks until one can be obtained
// or its associated context.Context is canceled.
//
// The methods AllowN, ReserveN, and WaitN consume n tokens.
type Limiter interface {
	// Allow is shorthand for AllowN(time.Now(), 1)
	Allow() bool

	// Use this method if you intend to drop / skip events that exceed the rate limit.
	// Otherwise use Reserve or Wait.
	AllowN(now time.Time, n int) bool

	// Reserve is shorthand for ReserveN(time.Now(), 1)
	Reserve() Reservation

	// ReserveN returns a Reservation that indicates how long the caller must wait before n events happen.
	// The Limiter takes this Reservation into account when allowing future events.
	// The returned Reservationâ€™s OK() method returns false if n exceeds the Limiter's burst size.
	// Usage example:
	//   r := lim.ReserveN(time.Now(), 1)
	//   if !r.OK() {
	//     // Not allowed to act! Did you remember to set lim.burst to be > 0 ?
	//     return
	//   }
	//   time.Sleep(r.Delay())
	//   Act()
	// Use this method if you wish to wait and slow down in accordance with the rate limit without dropping events.
	// If you need to respect a deadline or cancel the delay, use Wait instead.
	// To drop or skip events exceeding rate limit, use Allow instead.
	ReserveN(now time.Time, n int) Reservation

	// Wait is shorthand for WaitN(ctx, 1)

	// WaitN blocks until lim permits n events to happen.
	// It returns an error if n exceeds the Limiter's burst size, the Context is
	// canceled, or the expected wait time exceeds the Context's Deadline.
	// The burst limit is ignored if the rate limit is Inf.
	WaitN(ctx context.Context, n int) error

// A Reservation holds information about events that are permitted by a Limiter to happen after a delay.
// A Reservation may be canceled, which may enable the Limiter to permit additional events.
type Reservation interface {
	// Cancel is shorthand for CancelAt(time.Now())
	Cancel()

	// CancelAt indicates that the reservation holder will not perform the reserved action
	// and reverses the effects of this Reservation on the rate limit as much as possible,
	// considering that other reservations may have already been made.
	CancelAt(now time.Time)

	// Delay is shorthand for DelayFrom(time.Now())
	Delay() time.Duration

	// DelayFrom returns the duration for which the reservation holder must wait
	// before taking the reserved action.  Zero duration means act immediately.
	// InfDuration means the limiter cannot grant the tokens requested in this
	// Reservation within the maximum wait time.
	DelayFrom(now time.Time) time.Duration

	// OK returns whether the limiter can provide the requested number of tokens
	// within the maximum wait time.  If OK is false, Delay returns InfDuration, and
	// Cancel does nothing.
